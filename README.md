Why is a Version Control System useful when developing software both as an individual developer and as part of a development team?

Software Development Project Lifecycle

The key stages of a Software Development Project Lifecycle are understood to be Planning, Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Evaluation, Documentation and Maintenance.  Version Control becomes incredibly important from the Design stage forward.  Iterative changes to any software solution will happen between the Design and Maintenance stages and being able to ‘roll-back’ to previous versions of a software solution is necessary e.g.  if the Requirements change; if there are opportunities to enhance the software solution or if the software solution doesn’t fulfil all of the customer’s requirements.  Any number of changes can result in rolling-back a software solution to an earlier version; it’s important not to lose this work and to be able to return to earlier versions timely and with ease.

GitHub

GitHub can support version control for software development because it can:

- Hold both a programming language and any supporting text e.g. it may explain alongside the new programming, what programming changes were completed and why.
- Summarise the journey of a document or programme’s development over a period of time e.g. it would be able to pinpoint specific changes (i.e. date/time), who undertook those changes as well as why the changes were implemented and return a software solution to any of its given versions.

Benefits to Individual Developers

An individual developer can benefit in different ways from version control through an online solution such as GitHub; they can be more creative in their programming solutions because they can:

- Maintain the /current version of the programme while ‘branching off’ to experiment with programming the software solution
- Maintain notes that are understandable to them, so when they return to their work or need to explain their programming to their wider team, that this is easy to do
- Merge their programming with the current version of the software solution, if it is accepted by the development team as part of the wider software solution. 
 -Even if their programming is accepted as part of the software solution, it can be ‘rolled-back’ to the earlier version if required. 

Benefits to the Development Team

A development team can benefit in similar ways from version control through an online solution such as GitHub e.g.

- Where there are conflicts in the software solution, different version can be merged together in a new version to remove these conflicts and understand how the different versions can work effectively together.
- Even if a version of the software solution is accepted by the development team, it can be ‘rolled-back’ to the earlier version if required. 

Some additional benefits could be:

- Version control within a team can allow many people to work on programming the software solution, at any one time, without impacting on the current version, giving flexibility in the development of the software solution.
- The development team can view all versions of a software solution and decide which one meets the customer’s requirements most effectively.  This may not be one developer’s solution but the amalgamation of two or more solutions.
- It can allow a development team to retain programming which, at the time, may have not met the Requirements, however, may be useful or be an alternative solution later the software development project lifecycle.
